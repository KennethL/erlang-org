<h1>What is an EEP?</h1>

<p>EEP stands for Erlang Extension Proposal, or Erlang Enhancement
Process.  It is a concept borrowed from the <a href="http://www.python.org" title="We are very grateful to the Python community for devising such a good process for language revisions and for placing their documents in the public domain">Python</a> language to
facilitate community involvement in developing Erlang.  This document
is heavily based on <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/" title="PEP 1, PEP Purpose and Guidelines, Goodger, Hylton, Warsaw">PEP 1</a>.  An EEP is a design document providing
information to the Erlang community, or describing a new feature for
Erlang or its processes or environment.  The EEP should provide a
concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the
feature.</p>

<p>We intend EEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Erlang.  The EEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.</p>

<p>Because the EEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their <a href="http://www.github.com/erlang/eep/" title="EEP Sources at Github">revision history</a> is the historical record of
the feature proposal.</p>

<h1>EEP Types</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of EEPs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A <strong>Standards Track</strong> EEP describes a new feature or implementation
for Erlang.</p></li>
<li><p>A <strong>Process</strong> EEP describes a process surrounding Erlang, or
proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process EEPs are 
like Standards Track EEPs but apply to areas other than the Erlang
language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
Erlang's codebase; they often require community consensus; they are
more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore
them.  Examples include release schedules, procedures, guidelines,
changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or
environment used in Erlang development.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>EEP Work Flow</h1>

<p>The EEP editors assign EEP numbers and change their status.  Please
send all EEP-related email to <a href="&#109;a&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#x65;&#101;&#x70;&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#114;&#108;&#x61;&#110;&#x67;&#x2E;&#111;&#x72;&#103;">&#x65;&#101;&#x70;&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#114;&#108;&#x61;&#110;&#x67;&#x2E;&#111;&#x72;&#103;</a>.</p>

<p>The EEP process begins with a new idea for Erlang.  It is highly
recommended that a single EEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. The more focused the EEP, the more successful it tends to
be. The EEP editor reserves the right to reject EEP proposals if they
appear too unfocused or too broad.  If in doubt, split your EEP into
several well-focused ones.</p>

<p>Each EEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the EEP using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around
the idea.  The EEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to
ascertain whether the idea is EEP-able.  Posting to the
<a href="&#x6D;&#97;&#x69;&#x6C;&#116;o:&#x65;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x6E;&#103;&#x2D;&#x71;&#117;e&#115;&#x74;&#105;&#x6F;n&#115;&#64;&#101;&#x72;&#108;&#97;n&#103;&#46;o&#114;&#x67;">&#x65;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#x6E;&#103;&#x2D;&#x71;&#117;e&#115;&#x74;&#105;&#x6F;n&#115;&#64;&#101;&#x72;&#108;&#97;n&#103;&#46;o&#114;&#x67;</a> mailing list is recommended. Small
enhancements or patches often don't need a EEP and can be injected
into the Erlang development work flow by sending a patch to
<a href="&#x6D;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#101;r&#x6C;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x67;&#45;&#x70;a&#116;&#x63;&#104;e&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#x72;&#x6C;&#97;&#x6E;&#x67;&#x2E;o&#114;&#103;">&#101;r&#x6C;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x67;&#45;&#x70;a&#116;&#x63;&#104;e&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#x72;&#x6C;&#97;&#x6E;&#x67;&#x2E;o&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>

<p>The EEP champion writes a rough but fleshed out draft of the EEP, with
a proposed title. This draft must be written in EEP style as described
below. Then, after subscribing to the email list <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#x6C;&#x74;&#x6F;:&#101;&#x65;&#x70;&#x73;&#64;&#101;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#111;&#x72;&#x67;">&#101;&#x65;&#x70;&#x73;&#64;&#101;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#46;&#111;&#x72;&#x67;</a>,
the EEP champion sends the EEP to that list.  Note that the list has a
size limit for posts, at the time of writing 128 KByte, so EEPs with
attachments that are too large will bounce. Large attachments can be
put on a suitable web page and then be referred to from the EEP.  If
that is not possible, ask on the list how to submit the large EEP in
question.</p>

<p>If the EEP editor approves, she/he will assign the EEP a number, label
it as Standards Track or Process, give it status "Draft", and create
and check-in the initial draft of the EEP.  The EEP editor will not
unreasonably deny a EEP.  Reasons for denying EEP status include
duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper
motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping
with the Erlang philosophy.</p>

<p>If a pre-EEP is rejected, the author may elect to take the pre-EEP to
the <a href="&#x6D;a&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#111;:&#x65;&#x72;&#108;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x67;&#45;&#x71;&#x75;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#105;&#x6F;&#x6E;&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#110;&#x67;&#x2E;&#111;&#x72;&#103;">&#x65;&#x72;&#108;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x67;&#45;&#x71;&#x75;&#x65;&#x73;&#x74;&#105;&#x6F;&#x6E;&#x73;&#64;&#x65;&#114;&#x6C;&#x61;&#110;&#x67;&#x2E;&#111;&#x72;&#103;</a> mailing list to help flesh it out,
gain feedback and consensus from the community at large, and improve
the EEP for re-submission.</p>

<p>The author of the EEP is then responsible for posting the EEP to the
community forums, and marshaling community support for it.  As updates
are necessary, the EEP author can check in new versions if they have
commit permissions, can email new EEP versions or diffs to the EEP
editor for committing, or submit changes in any other suitable
way for the version control system.</p>

<p>Standards Track EEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  The EEP should be reviewed and accepted
before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference
implementation will aid people in studying the EEP.  Standards Track
EEPs must include an implementation -- in the form of code, a patch,
or a URL to same -- before it can be considered Final.</p>

<p>EEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a EEP
before submitting it for review.  A EEP that has not been discussed on
the erlang mailing list will not be accepted.  However, wherever
possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should
be avoided.  Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include:
setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the EEP
author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up
a wiki page, etc.  EEP authors should use their discretion here.</p>

<p>Once the authors have completed a EEP, they must inform the EEP editor
that it is ready for review. EEPs are reviewed by a committee of
people from the Erlang/OTP and the Erlang community who may accept or
reject a EEP or send it back to the author(s) for revision.  For a EEP
that is pre-determined to be acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win
as-is and/or its implementation has already been checked in) the
Erlang/OTP team may also initiate a EEP review, first notifying the
EEP author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.</p>

<p>The committee members are the internal Erlang/OTP Technical Board plus
for the specific case summoned experts.</p>

<p>For a EEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate
the interpreter unduly. Finally, a proposed enhancement must be
compatible with the Erlang philosophy in order to be accepted.</p>

<p>Once a EEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted,
the status will be changed to "Final".</p>

<p>A EEP can also be assigned status "Deferred". The EEP author or editor
can assign the EEP this status when no progress is being made on the
EEP.  Once a EEP is deferred, the EEP editor can re-assign it to draft
status.</p>

<p>A EEP can also be "Rejected". Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this
fact.</p>

<p>EEPs can also be replaced by a different EEP, rendering the original
obsolete.</p>

<p>EEP work flow is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="eep-0001-1.png" alt="EEP Work Flow" title="EEP Work Flow" /></p>

<p>Some Process EEPs may also have a status of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. <a href="eep-0001.html" title="EEP 1, EEP Purpose and Guidelines, Gustafsson">EEP 1</a> (this EEP).</p>

<h1>What belongs in a successful EEP?</h1>

<p>Each EEP should have the following parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
EEP, including the EEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
contact info for each author, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
being addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Copyright/public domain -- Each EEP must either be explicitly
labelled as placed in the public domain (see this EEP as an
example) or licensed under the <a href="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/" title="Open Publication License">Open Publication License</a>, or
the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
syntax and semantics of any new language feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
interoperable implementations.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation -- The motivation is critical for EEPs that want to
change the Erlang language. It should clearly explain why the
existing language specification is inadequate to address the
problem that the EEP solves. EEP submissions without sufficient
motivation may be rejected outright.</p></li>
<li><p>Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
describing what motivated the design and why particular design
decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is
supported in other languages.</p>

<p>The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
during discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Backwards Compatibility -- All EEPs that introduce backwards
incompatibilities must include a section describing these
incompatibilities and their severity.  The EEP must explain how
the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.  EEP
submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
may be rejected outright.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
completed before any EEP is given status "Final", but it need not
be completed before the EEP is accepted.  It is better to finish
the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it
before writing code.</p>

<p>The final implementation must include test code and documentation
appropriate for either the Erlang language reference or the
standard library reference.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>EEP Format and Template</h1>

<p>An EEP is written as an UTF-8-encoded text file in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown Home Page">Markdown</a> format.
<a href="eep-0033.html" title="EEP 33, Sample Markdown EEP Template, Niskanen">EEP 33</a> is a template and contains an instruction of how to write
an EEP.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.github.com/erlang/eep/" title="EEP Sources at Github">repository</a> there is also a version of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown Home Page">Markdown</a>
Perl program, a Makefile and a Perl script for building the <a href="eep-0000.html" title="EEP Index">EEP index</a>.
Just give the command <code>make</code> in the toplevel directory.</p>

<h1>EEP Header Preamble</h1>

<p>Each EEP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble all indented
four spaces to make them <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown Home Page">Markdown</a> code style.  The headers must
appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are optional
and are described below.  All other headers are required:</p>

<pre><code>    Author: &lt;list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs&gt;
    * Discussions-To: &lt;email address&gt;
    Status: &lt;Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Final | Replaced&gt;
    Type: &lt;Standards Track | Process&gt;
    * Content-Type: &lt;text/plain | text/x-rst&gt;
    * Requires: &lt;eep numbers&gt;
    Created: &lt;date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format&gt;
    * Erlang-Version: &lt;version number&gt;
    Post-History: &lt;dates of postings to erlang-questions&gt;
    * Replaces: &lt;eep number, ...&gt;
    * Replaced-By: &lt;eep number, ...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then follows a Markdown horizontal rule, the EEP number and title
as a Markdown header 2, and a blank line, all required:
    <em>*</em>*
    EEP <eep number>: <eep title>
    ----</p>

<p>The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the EEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be</p>

<pre><code>Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if the email address is included, and just</p>

<pre><code>Random J. User
</code></pre>

<p>if the address is not given.</p>

<p>If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.  Note that personal
email addresses should be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.</p>

<p>While a EEP is in private discussions (usually during the initial
Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list
or URL where the EEP is being discussed.  No Discussions-To header is
necessary if the EEP is being discussed privately with the author, or
on the erlang mailing list.  Remember to obscure email addresses here
to.</p>

<p>The Type header specifies the type of EEP: Standards Track or Process.</p>

<p>The Created header records the date that the EEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the EEP are posted to erlang-questions.  Both headers
should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2009.</p>

<p>Standards Track EEPs must have a Erlang-Version header which indicates
the version of Erlang that the feature will be released with.  Process
EEPs do not need a Erlang-Version header.</p>

<p>EEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the EEP numbers that this
EEP depends on..</p>

<p>EEPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a EEP has been
rendered obsolete by later EEP(s); the value is the number(s) of the
EEP(s) that replaces the current document.  The newer EEP(s) must have
a Replaces header containing the number(s) of the EEP(s) that it
rendered obsolete.</p>

<h1>Auxiliary Files</h1>

<p>EEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files must be
named <code>eep-XXXX-Y.ext</code>, where "XXXX" is the EEP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and ".ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. ".png").</p>

<h1>Reporting EEP Bugs, or Submitting EEP Updates</h1>

<p>How you report a bug, or submit a EEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the EEP, the preferences of the EEP
author, and the nature of your comments. For the early draft stages
of the EEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the EEP author. For more mature, or finished EEPs you may
want to submit corrections to the <a href="&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#101;&#x65;&#x70;s&#64;er&#108;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#46;&#x6F;&#x72;&#103;">&#101;&#x65;&#x70;s&#64;er&#108;&#97;&#110;&#x67;&#46;&#x6F;&#x72;&#103;</a> mailing list.</p>

<p>When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the EEP author and/or EEP editor.</p>

<p>EEP authors can update EEPs by submitting new versions to the editors.</p>

<h1>Transferring EEP Ownership</h1>

<p>It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of EEPs to a
new champion.  In general, we'd like to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred EEP, but that's really up to the
original author.  A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the EEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the
direction of the EEP.  We try to build consensus around a EEP, but if
that's not possible, you can always submit a competing EEP.</p>

<p>If you are interested in assuming ownership of a EEP, send a message
asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the EEP
editor <a href="&#x6D;&#97;&#x69;l&#x74;&#111;:&#x65;&#x65;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#x72;&#x6C;&#97;&#x6E;g&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#x67;">&#x65;&#x65;&#112;&#115;&#64;&#101;&#x72;&#x6C;&#97;&#x6E;g&#x2E;&#111;&#114;&#x67;</a>.  If the original author doesn't respond to
email in a timely manner, the EEP editor will make a unilateral
decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).</p>

<h1>Copyright</h1>
