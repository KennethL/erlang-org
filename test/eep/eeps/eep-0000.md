EEP 0: Index of Erlang Enhancement Proposals (EEPs)
----



Introduction
============

The EEP contains the index of all Erlang Enhancement Proposals,
known as EEPs.  EEP numbers are assigned by the EEP Editor, and
once assigned are never changed.  The [history][1] of the EEP
texts represent their historical record.

The textual format for an EEP is described in [EEP 1][],
and [EEP 33][] is a template.

EEPs are discussed on the [mailing list][3] <eeps@erlang.org> and
accepted or rejected by the OTP team.
