# Mailing lists
The erlang.org [mailing lists](http://erlang.org/mailman/listinfo/) are:

* [erlang-questions](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/)  
The main Erlang/OTP discussion list. This list is mirrored by the (searchable) Google Group [Erlang Programming](http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-programming).
* [erlang-announce](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-announce/)  
If you only want to be notified of new releases, subscribe to this list. There is no need to subscribe to this list if you already subscribe to __erlang-questions__, announcements are sent to both lists. You can not post to this list - only moderators can.
* [eeps](http://erlang.org/pipermail/eep/)  
Discussions regarding specific [EEPs](../eep) (Erlang Extension Proposals). See [Erlang Enhancement Process](../eep).

## Forums
* [Erlang Programming](http://groups.google.com/group/erlang-programming)  
This Google Group mirrors our mailing list erlang-questions.

## Mailing lists mini-HowTo
The mailing lists are [Mailman](http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/) mailing lists. They have a [web interface](http://erlang.org/mailman/listinfo/) explaining what you need to know about handling your subscription.

You have to be a member to post. This reduces spam to a tolerable level. You can subscribe for every post, digest of posts or no-mail subscription to be able to post but read some other way e.g the archives or maybe Google Groups.
