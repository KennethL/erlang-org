 ErlangCamp is back, this time in Coruña Spain the 5-6:th of October.

 We felt it our duty as good upstanding engineers to let you know about ErlangCamp 2012 which will be held in Coruña Spain this Oct 5th and 6th.

 Why Erlang? Why ErlangCamp? And what could I possibly learn in two days?

 In two days, you learn how to build world-class solutions using the technology that powers NoSQL data stores like Basho’s Riak and CouchDB, enterprise messaging platforms like VMWare’s RabbitMQ and ejabbard, Erlang Solutions’ OpenFlow software-defined network (SDN) switch LINC, VoIP platforms like Kazoo, financial exchange systems, and commercial solutions from companies like Ericsson, Klarna, Campajna, Tail-f Systems, 2600Hz, Machine Zone, ShoreTel, and Quviq.

 Your instructors are experts at developing real-world Erlang/OTP-based solutions, including two of the authors of the "Erlang and OTP in Action" (<http://manning.com/logan>)

 And, of course, you will be at the Universidade da Coruña, in scenic Northern Spain (Note* the program is in English). Take a couple extra days, and make it a working vacation!
