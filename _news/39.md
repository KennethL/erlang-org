[ErlangCamp](http://erlangcamp.com) is back, this time in Boston. This year we have partnered with Erlang Solutions and their Erlang University Program. There is not enough information out there relating to how you write real production grade Erlang systems. ErlangCamp is a 2 day inexpensive workshop (12-13 August) that teach exactly that. The workshop will teach participants how to construct solid production grade Erlang OTP software. Among the instructors are the authors of [Erlang and OTP in Action](http://manning.com/logan).
