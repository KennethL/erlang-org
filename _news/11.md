 Erlang User Conference 2015

 Stockholm 11-12 June

 Call For Talks ends on 17 March

  

 EUC 2015 will take place on 11-12 June, with one day of tutorials on 10 June and 3 days of expert training on 8-10 June: [http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015](http://www.erlang-factory.com/euc2015)

  

 We are looking for passionate people who made an interesting innovation, open-source application or product with Erlang/OTP/Elixir. If you used Erlang or Elixir in a real-world project or you developed a cool tool, we want to hear about it! We are seeking talks aimed at beginners as much as for talks suited for more experienced users. This is to help newer members to the Erlang community make the maximum out of the EUC as well.    

  

 The deadline for talk proposals is **17 March**, please submit your talk here: [http://goo.gl/forms/bO9kU9PYrr](http://goo.gl/forms/bO9kU9PYrr)
