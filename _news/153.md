# OTP 25-rc1 

Erlang/OTP 25-rc1 is the first release candidate of three before the OTP 25.0 release. It contains a lot of new functionality as well as bugfixes and a few incompatibilities. The purpose with the release candidates is to get feedback from you as users so please build and run the code.

Below are some highlights of the release:

## Highlights

- **crypto**: The `crypto` app in OTP can now be compiled, linked and
               used with the new `OpenSSL 3.0` cryptolib. It has not yet been extensively tested, 
               so only recommended for experiments and alpha testing in this release. 
               There are not yet any guaranties that it works, not even together with other
               OTP applications like for example SSL and SSH, although
               there are no known errors.
- **erts**: An option for enabling dirty scheduler specific
               allocator instances has been introduced. By default
               such allocator instances are disabled. For more
               information see the documentation of the `+Mdai` argument
               to the `erl`command

- **erl_docgen, erts**: All predefined types have been added to the `erlang`
              module together with documentation.
              Any reference to a predefined type now links to that
              documentation so that the user can view it.

- **erts**: Responsiveness of processes executing on normal or low
               priority could suffer due to code purging or literal
               area removal on systems with a huge amount of
               processes. This since during these operations all
               processes on the system were scheduled for execution at
               once. The new solution is to limit the number of outstanding 
               purge and copy requests to 2 times the number of schedulers as default
