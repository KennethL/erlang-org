The Dublin Erlang Factory is a single day conference focused on Erlang and Elixir programming. It’s undoubtedly a great opportunity for all tech lovers passionate about Erlang/OTP/Elixir programming to meet up, learn about new emerging technologies, exchange ideas, inspire and get inspired by others!

The Dublin Erlang Factory Lite 2015 will take place Friday afternoon on 11 Sept, hosted by the friendly folks at AOL.

The programme and speaker lineup includes Joe Armstrong, Erlang's Co-Inventor, sharing his brilliant ideas through a keynote talk and also a tutorial (a limited number of seats still available), Philip Clarke (AOL) diving into the topic of Real Time Bidding Exchange, Christopher Brown (University of St Andrews) presenting LAPEDO framework for programming heterogeneous multicore systems in Erlang, and many more.

The Erlang Factory Lite is co-organised by AOL and Erlang Solutions and is organised in conjunction with the Kats Conf 15.
