[Erlang User Conference 2011](http://www.erlang-factory.com).
 It is  with great pleasure that we announce the launch of the 2011 Erlang User  Conference in Stockholm. The date for your diary is 3 November 2011.  Early Bird registration will open on 15 August so in the meantime if you  wish to [submit a talk](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/ErlangUserConference2011/submit_talk), we would love to hear from you. 

 After  the success of last year's Conference and it selling out, you will want  to book your place early. The Erlang User Conference brings together the  best minds and names in Erlang programming from language inventors,  implementers and maintainers. Open source committers, community leaders  and Erlang authors. Everyone who is anyone will be at the Erlang User Conference 2011!
