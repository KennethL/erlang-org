We are happy to announce the issue tracker for Erlang/OTP (http://bugs.erlang.org). Our intention is that the issue tracker replaces the erlang-bugs mailing list, in order to make it easier for the community to report bugs, suggest improvements and new features. You can start using the issue tracker today. The issue tracker for Erlang/OTP is a step towards improving and formalising the process of community contributions, a goal which is actively worked on by the Industrial Erlang User Group. The IEUG is working with Ericsson to improve libraries, tool chains, middle-ware and contributions while spreading awareness and increasing user adoption. **FAQ** **1. Where is the issue tracker?** bugs.erlang.org **2. Will I still be able to use the erlang-bugs mailing list?** We recommend you to report new bugs at bugs.erlang.org instead. You are still able to use erlang-bugs and see its archives, but we won't be looking at it as often. We will gradually phase out the erlang-bugs mailing list.  **3. How do I create an issue or feature request?** Create an account or Log in with an existing account. Select Create Issue after you log in. You can also log in with your Erlangcentral.org account if you have one. **4. What types of issue can I report?** Bug, Improvement, New Feature
