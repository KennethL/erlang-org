Hey everyone,

We are pleased to announce the launch of the brand new [Erlang Forums](https://hello.erlangforums.com).

We have been very impressed with how the Elixir Forum has been managed over the last five years and so we approached Aston to ask whether he would be interested in putting together something similar for Erlang. He agreed and we are now just going live.

We’d appreciate your support on the forum as we consider it an important part of Erlang’s future growth plans.

Although our other channels will remain open for now, for the foreseeable future the Erlang Core Team will be focusing their time on the forum and we’d love for you to join us. The forum offers something for everyone as it includes many mailing-list and chat type features, all presented with a modern UI and a fresh look and feel. We’re also pleased that Joe’s memory will be honoured on the forum by being the inspiration behind many of its goals, including the aim of being warm and friendly. Just like he was.

Thank you in advance for your support and we look forward to seeing you there!

The Erlang Core Team
