 There will be a planned power outage at Sun 15 Dec 7:00-14:00 CET
 in the building where the erlang.org servers are located.  So all
 services (www, mail, ...) will be down at least during that period.

 We are sorry for any inconveniences this may cause the community.

 ...edit...

 Our Internet provider cut the power to the internet router already at Fri 19:00 CET, so we were down almost all the weekend.  Apparently sh*** happens.  Sorry about that!

 We are back up again, apparently... Hello World!
