Erlang/OTP 19.0 is a new major release with new features, quite a few (characteristics) improvements, as well as a few incompatibilities.

Some highlights of the release are:
- **compiler, stdlib**:
  - New preprocessor macros `?FUNCTION_NAME`, `?FUNCTION_ARITY`
  - New preprocessor directives `-error(Term)` and `-warning(Term)` to cause a compilation error or warning, respectively.
- **gen_statem** a new state machine behavior
- **mnesia_ext**: plugin of external storage solutions to mnesia
- **crypto**: uses EVP interface in OpenSSL resulting in generally better performance and support for HW acceleration
- **ssh**: performance improvements, uses the new `gen_statem` behavior
- **ssl**: enhanced error log messages
- **dialyzer**: the support for maps is very much extended both the type specification syntax and the type analysis.
- **erts**:
  - `erlang:open_port(spawn, ...)` 3-5 times faster
  - tracing, extensive improvements (scalability, speed, match specifications on send/receive, support for lttng, ...)
  - dirty schedulers improved
  - per process configurable handling of message_queue
  - fast loading of multiple modules
  - max_heap_size process flag
- **erts/kernel**:
  Experimental support for Unix Domain Sockets
  Example: `gen_udp:open(0, [{ifaddr,{local,"/tmp/socket"}}])`
- and much more ....
